# 🌐 SmartTabs — A Smarter Way to Handle Too Many Tabs

SmartTabs is a simple Chrome extension built for people like me (and probably you) — people who always have way too many tabs open, but don’t want to close any of them *just in case* we need them later.

Instead of forcing you to manually organize things, SmartTabs tries to be helpful in the background: grouping your tabs by topic, spotting duplicates, and making it easier to find what you’re looking for — no stress, no clutter.

## ✨ What It Can Do

- 🧠 **Groups your tabs by category**  
  Tabs are automatically grouped into sections like "AI & Tech", "Social", "Shopping", etc. — based on the tab’s title or URL.

- 🔗 **Click any tab title to jump to it**  
  Just click and go — even if it’s in another window.

- 🧹 **Detects duplicate tabs**  
  Finds any tabs with the same URL and marks them as duplicates.

- 🗑️ **One-click cleanup for duplicates**  
  Hit the “Close Duplicate Tabs” button to clean up extras and keep just one of each.

- 🍞 **Toast notification**  
  When you clean up tabs, a little popup tells you how many were closed. Satisfying.

- 🌙 **Dark mode toggle**  
  Light or dark — you choose. It even remembers your preference.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I was tired of:
- Losing track of what I had open
- Opening 5 copies of the same site
- Never wanting to close tabs "just in case"

I didn’t want to micromanage my browser — I just wanted it to **understand what I was doing and help out**. So I built SmartTabs to be the kind of extension I wish already existed.
